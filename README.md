## About this Project 
This website is meant to serve as a resource for the students of Poolesville High School (PHS) by assisting them with their 3D printing endevors. 

There are two "modes" for this website, the admin account, and the user account. 
Students can upload STL files and see their place in a queue for printing. Teachers have admin permissions and can log into the website and see all of the files to download and print.

This project is ongoing, changes still to be made
